Redux Tutorial Notes:

- Redux is a fancy state machine
- Redux functions (aka Reducers) must be pure, ex:
	def square(x):
		return x * x

- Pure = not making any method calls or modify input arg
	+ MUST be pure b/c states are OBJECTS
	+ Modifying object value !modify reference...so state unchanged

- Reducers calc next state based on prev state & action dispatched

- subsribe() is for child components to update once the store changes
	+ ...but Redux's 'connect()' takes care of all that 

- Redux flow: 
	1. Click a component
	2. That creates an action
	3. Dispatch the action
	4. Store runs reducer (to det. next state)

- mapStateToProps is run ANYTIME store modifies state

- mapDispatchToProps run ONCE during init to est. button handlers

React Notes:
- render() called asynchronously whenever virtual DOM != actual DOM

- Most Popular Lifecycle hooks:
	+ Note: Can ONLY be used in classes (not stateless functional components)!
	1. Mount:
		a. constructor (good place to init state/props)
		b. render 
		c. componentDidMount (good place for ajax calls)
	2. Update:
		a. render  b. componentDidUpdate
	3. Unmount:
		a. componentDidUnmount

- When the parent's state is changed, she bubbles this change down to all children, causing them all to re-render() and continue other lifecycle hooks

Javascript Notes:
- In Javascript, setting two arrays equal to each other sets REFERENCES equals
	+ Need to use b = [...a] to clone an array
